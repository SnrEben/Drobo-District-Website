			<H1>THE MISSION AND VISION STATEMENT OF THE CHURCH OF PENTECOST</H1>
			<h2>The Mission Statement</h2>

			<div class="VISION">

				<h1>The Vision Statement</h1>
				<h4>To become a Pentecostal church that is culturally relevant in vibrant evangelism, church planting, discipleship and holistic ministry.</h4>
				<h2>The Core Values </h2>
				<h3>Evangelism</h3>
				<h4>*	Evangelism is the presentation of Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit with the view that people will come and trust Jesus as Savior and Lord and serve him in the fellowship of the Church. Evangelism is the responsibility of every Church member. It is the prime duty of every believer to share his/her faith after conversion.</h4>
<h4>* The scope of evangelism was initially Ghana, extending to Africa and to the whole world. Evangelism is missions-oriented; farmers, women, artisans, fishermen, intellectuals, etc. go out into other countries, preach Christ, open churches and call in ministers to pastor same. Besides, as was the practice of the founder, Pastor James McKeown, we respond to calls to missions as led by the Spirit of the Lord.
</h4>
<h3>Discipleship</h3>
<h4>*	Discipleship is training believers to be like Christ. The emphasis is on holiness, righteousness, faithfulness, honesty, sincerity, humility, prayerfulness and the leading of disciplined and responsible lives.</h4>
<h4>*	This is done at the level of individuals, where every member takes responsibility to discipline their new coverts, as well as through church/corporate based systematic teaching, and on-the-job training.</h4>
<h4>*	Teaching emphasizes the four-square gospel, which is Christ-centered: i.e. Jesus the Savior, Healer, Baptizer and Soon Coming King; the Tenets of the Church; Bible reading/study and scripture memorization and application of the Word to life situations.
</h4>
<h3>Ministry Excellence</h3>
<h4>*	We seek to honor God who gave His best (the Savior) by maintaining a high standard of excellence in all our ministries and activities (Col. 3:23-24).</h4>
<h3> Prayer</h3>
<h4>*	Some of the normal practices are regular prayer for the Holy Spirit baptism with initial evidence of speaking in tongues. Emphasis is placed on the fruit and gifts of the Spirit in the life of the believer.</h4>
<h4>*	Prayers are said for healing and deliverance for the afflicted as part of the initial exercises for salvation.</h4>
<h4>*	Services are marked as truly Pentecostal with praise and worship, teaching, exercise of gifts, prayer, testimony, etc.</h4>
<h3> The Holy Spirit</h3>
<h4>*	We believe in the presence of the person of the Holy Spirit and that the Christian life can be led only with His grace. The new birth is the work of the Holy Spirit, and then the baptism of the Holy Spirit for power to serve and the gifts of the Spirit for building the body of Christ.</h4>
<h4>*	The Holy Spirit helps the individual to develop a Christ-like character, manifest through bearing the fruit of the Spirit.</h4>
<h4>*	The leading of the Holy Spirit in all spheres of activity in the Church is paramount. Administrative structures and all other church distinctiveness have been by the leading of the Holy Spirit. The Church, through her leadership at all levels, co-operates in obedience.</h4>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
<h4>*	Leadership development is based on the apostolic foundation. Appointments and callings into leadership positions are based on character and charisma, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Leadership development is from the shop floor, grass root level with members maturing to lead sub-groups, movements, assemblies, districts and areas. Team spirit with talent development shapes team work. Ministry is by both clergy and laity.</h4>
<h1>The Tenth of The Church</h1>
<h3>The Bible</h3>
<h4>We believe in the divine inspiration and authority of the Holy Scriptures. That the Bible is infallible in its declaration, final in its authority, all-sufficient in its provisions and comprehensive in its sufficiency. (2 Timothy 3.16, 2 Peter 1.21)</h4>


<h3>The One True God</h3>
<h4>We believe in the existence of the One True God, Elohim, maker of the whole universe; undefinable, but revealed as Triune Godhead---Father, Son and Holy Spirit---One in nature, essence, and attributes, omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. (Genesis 1.1, Matthew 3.16--17, 2 Corinthians 13.14, Matthew 18.19, Genesis 1.26)</h4>


<h3>Man's Depraved Nature</h3>
<h4>We believe that "all men have sinned and come short of the glory of God;" and are subject to eternal punishment; and need repentance and regeneration. (Genesis 3.1--19, Isaiah 53.6)</h4>


<h3>The Saviour</h3>
<h4>We believe man's need of a Saviour has been met in the person of Christ Jesus, because of his deity, virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, resurrection and ascension; His abiding intercession and second coming. (John 8.46, 14.30, Colossians 1.15, 2 Corinthians 5.19, Romans 3.25, Acts 2.36, Philippians 2.9--11, 1 Thessalonians 4.16--17, Revelation 22.20)</h4>


<h3>Repentance, Regeneration, Justification, and Sanctification</h3>
<h4>We believe all men have to repent of and confess their sins before God, and believe on the vicarious death of Christ Jesus before they can be justified before God. We believe in the Sanctification of the believer through the working of the Holy Spirit and in God's gift of Eternal Life to the believer. (Acts 4.25, Romans 5.16, 1 Corinthians 1.30, 1 Thessalonians 4.3)</h4>


<h3>The Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper</h3>
<h4>We believe in the Sacrament of baptism by immersion, as a testimony of a convert who has attained a responsible age of say 13 years (Luke 3.21, Mark 10.16) (Infants and children are not baptised but are dedicated to the Lord), (Luke 2.22--24, 34, Mark 10.16). We believe in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper which should be partaken by all members who are in full fellowship. (Luke 22.19--20, Matthew 26.21--29, Acts 20.7)</h4>


<h3>The Fruit, Baptism, and Gifts of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<h4>We believe in Baptism of the Holy Spirit for believers with signs following; and in the operation of the gifts and the fruit of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. (1 Corinthians 12.8--11, Mark 16.17, Acts 2.4, Galatians 5.22)</h4>


<h3>Divine Healing</h3>
<h4>We believe that the healing of sickness and disease is provided for God's people in the atonement. (Isaiah 53.4--5, Matthew 8.7, 17, Mark 16.13, James 5.14--16, Luke 13.10-16) Yet the church is not opposed to soliciting the help of qualified medical practitioners.</h4>


<h3>Tithes and Offerings</h3>
<h4>We believe in tithing and in the giving of free will offerings towards the Kingdom of God. We believe that God blesses a cheerful giver. (Malachi 3.10, Hebrews 7.1--4, Luke 6.8, Acts 20.35)</h4>


<h3>The Second Coming of Christ and the Next Life</h3>
<h4>We believe in the second coming of Christ and the resurrection of both the saved and the unsaved. They that are saved to the resurrection of life---and the unsaved to the resurrection of damnation. (John 5.28--29, Daniel 12.2, Romans 2.7, 6.23, 1 John 1.1--2)</h4>
<h3> Marriage and Family life</h3>
<h4>*We believe in the institution of marriage as a union established and ordanied by God for the lifelong, intimate relationship between a man as husband and a woman as wife, as biologically defined. </h4>
<h4>* We believe that God instituted marriage primarily for companionship, and for procreation and the godly nurture of children, to enable them find the security of love and growth in the heritage of faith (Gen. 2:18; 21-25; Matt. 19:4-6; 1 Cor. 7:1-2)</h4>
